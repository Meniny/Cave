title: "It's funny how you think you actually mean something to someone and they just turn around and prove you wrong. I wish I could read their mind. but then, I wonder if I could handle the truth, bcz it's hard to accept the truth when the lies were exactly what you wanted to hear. so pathetic. and this shocking end to the day is putting me in no mood to do anything."
