[TwinkleStar](https://github.com/Hecktorzr/TwinkleStar) is a small iOS library I wrote to handle device's LED through a convenient singleton.
It supports turning it on and off (again), setting up a strobe frequency and determining if a device counts with an integrated LED.
All conveniently wrapped in a cool singleton with the following interface:

```objc
@property CGFloat flashFrequency;
@property BOOL isFlashLEDAvailable;

+(HZTwinkleStar *)sharedTwinkleStar;

-(void)turnFlashLEDOn;
-(void)turnFlashLEDOff;
```

To make usage clear I've included an example project.
