.Intro
[cols=".^a,.^a"]
|===
|**Scoia'tael Gwent deck** is one of the 4 base decks available in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and considered the more flexible of them. Where the Nilfgaard and the Realms are truly straightforward and the Monsters are pure brute force comprised of monsters, the Squirrels focus on combining debuffs that affect the enemy units like the Weather cards, along with a moderately strong assortment of units.

|**Special** - Geralt chooses who goes first at the start of a round. If both players are using the Scoia'tael deck, then the normal coin flip is used.
