== Introduction

**Gwent cards** are special playing cards used in an ancient dwarven game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Gwent is a competitive sport in the Northern Realms, so you’ll need a great deck and a quick wit to beat some of the stronger players.

To build a great deck, you’ll need to collect rare cards. In this guide, we’re going to show you all the Gwent cards, their effects and locations. We also have a general **link:../guide/[Gwent guide]** for newcomers.

There are four faction decks to choose from when playing: the Northern Realms, the Nilfgaardian

Empire, the Scoia’tael and the Monsters. There are also neutral cards, which you can put in any deck. Each faction has its own unique cards, passive perks and leader abilities. You can unlock new cards by doing quests, buying them from vendors and finding them throughout the world.

== Innkeeper Elsa – White Orchard Gwent Card Purchase Location

Innkeeper Elsa in White Orchard tavern sells cards. You’ll talk with her during the main quest “Lilac and Gooseberries”.
