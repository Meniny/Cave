Gwent is an ancient dwarven card game you can play with many characters in The Witcher 3. If you’ve collected a bunch of Gwent cards and developed a winning Gwent strategy, you’re probably looking to play with some folks and gather the remaining cards.
In this guide, we’re going to show you where to find Gwent players and card sellers across the world.
