Currently one of the most important things is finally losing my attachment to somebody who's not good for me. i think sometimes my mind needs more time to accept what my mind already knows. everything is beautiful, it just takes the right angle to see it. who knows, tomorrow could be something i've been waiting for. i can love you to death, and still cut you off. well done.
